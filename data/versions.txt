version manager:


1.0.0: added the homepage, including the routing and the WelcomeController + index function
1.0.1: added the version manager file in the data map
1.0.2: slight progress on the homepage styling






how the versions work:

An example of a version: 1.19.36

the [1] indicates a major update, an example would be a complete rework of the logic,
its possible that a update of this caliber wouldn't happen during this project.

the [19] indicates an update which added content such as a new page
or an update which incluces logic, such as a login system.

the [36] indicates a smal update, this can either be added styling to a page,
or a small logic fix (resolved bugs/slightly expanded features)
